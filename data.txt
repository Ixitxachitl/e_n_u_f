least complicated ultra star
what do u think about the high variety in difficulty in this hack?
it's illegal to do UltraStar thats blind readable
the line guide switch is too much in this level imo - it would ve been greater without it. theres already a lot of stuff
brakkiJam
the fast bg is a nice touch
I like them too

yo oreos! GG on the charity stream, dude dangilAww
thanks gr8ful3LOVE yeah it went great
I don't think it will despawn
Your just gamin brakkiBrammies
half these line guides don't make sense to me
@Pixelninetales would ve been clearer if the "always on" lineguides were in a different collor or sth
no it's because you jump to switch them but half the time you're required to jump they switch to the correct state anyway
so what's the point

No one really gets it but the first half is Tree upright, second half is the "baumgeist" (tree ghost) gets angry because you stole the miracle beer or whatever you wanna call it. So he chases you and the tree is sideways (Forest right). And this section the tree is upside-down. Forest on top, sky on bottom. Rops and boos are also the way they should be looking

this is why shovda put her lore in the level titles for dysphoria Kappa

my argument is that most ignored lore is, sadly, a way of telling the creator that the lore is not compelling.

o yeah, i noticed they changed it yesterday but i think its p cool
easter egg search now?
it doesn't have a blinking nose now so that's a plus
just like smb1 lore is not as layered as The Last of us lore
oh waht? didnt notice i am not in the credits despite playtesting :( now i know
Jaize brakkiHug
i miss the blinking nostrils
and the nature of the game itself is not so much about lore than making red man jump
as yous aid.
@firstnamebutt DinoDance
Don't get why they don't just make a new Dino dance emote remixed instead
Its pretty hard to find though. But its pretty far at the end of this section
both are cool with me

I wonder if the twitch alert with the old dino shooting lasers out of their nose is still active
my dear driko. you'll be happy to hear that i feel like i had a brekathrough in lm yesterday
as someone who made a hack with lore, I did it for the same reason any creator makes any decision- I wanted to. it?s how I engaged with making the hack I wanted. players will ignore or not like any little thing you do so do what you want
@Abstract_Tribe based
yea I?m not saying don?t make lore in hacks

I?m just saying most players will kinda just rush past it

@Abstract_Tribe words of wisdom.
how can you tell
You were right there. You didnt trust the process all the way
i'm a lore enjoyer and even myself sometimes get entwined in the red man jumping train and forget to enjoy the lore
?
the lore is there if you want to care about it and ignored if you don?t care
yarr
Yeah. Me personally i like the level, but its way to blind and that makes it so long to play first time
Woah that parallax is nuts

no idea, there's not a huge rush for it, but there's a chance if it gets into a GDQ maybe that gives him more incentive, but I dunno

Can someone explain lol
morning chambo
Its just kinda like "anime reaction"
@hotsho111 shenanigans thats all that happens here.
hi i'm ready for work
ok, i made a new chatbot that say really dumb stuff this morning
hopefully nothing bad but nonsensical
like had i allowed it to respond to me when i said that it would have said "difficulty in this hacjk *hack song is paradox.. ported"
yeah, nonsense
i can kindof explain it
it remembers everything it sees
and then based on some randomness and some probability it chooses words that can go after other words
based on stuff it's seen
i just have it logging chat for a bit to learn
it doesn't really remember anything longterm or who said what
well, i can turn it on here and it will have a 5% chance to say something after anyone else says something
that doesn't mean expect a "response" but it'll say stuff
and it turns off when i leave so no worries about lingering bots
where? on my computer?
i don't care if you delete its messages but if you want me to be here banning it will ban me too
i spent years learning programming XD
Thank you so much for being here! If you'd like to support my stream directly, remember to hit that subscribe button! You'll get a special sub badge and emotes for joining the community! ????
the language i did this in is called python
you can install the thing that makes it work and then just run text files filled with code basically
i use a program called pycharm to help though
it has a bunch of shortcuts and tools to make it easier
but really it's a glorified text editor
well, it's here, surprised it isn't saying anything yet lol
i would know if it tried
it hasn't yet
also it is verified
that's why when you ban it it bans me, it's linked to my phone number
it's just being RNG shy
5% isn't a big chance to say stuff
but i don't want it to get spammy
WOOOWW LUL

I do get a 4 day weekend coming up though chambo2Bless
i wrote a bot that works like aniv and i'm training it on lots of text before i unleash it on willing participants
I'm trying to finish my hack
it remembers everything it sees and then decides based on a combination of probability and randomness what words should string together
it has no "intelligence" like chatgpt
aniv is free content. If that chat room is kinda dead, if aniv says something you can point it out on stream and do something funny
Some day I'll be able to get back to the suika chat interaction game
very close.
the more training data you give it the more possible things it can say
I started a game, but tried to end it quickly, and was just placing fruit along the left well and got like 1280 for a score LUL

did you watch the Pokemon day presentation? I know how much you love the pokemons chambo
Chambo did you play this on release day? How frustrating were the puzzles.
just saw it... this one is wild... who needs yoshis? chambo2Sip
even you would have been disappointed in the Pokemon annoucements
new legends game at least chambo2Shrug
Pokemon Legends Z-A
it was a very early tease. no gameplay. but releasing in 2025
seems like a legends game more similar to Arceus based on the XY games?
THANK YOU!!!!
I've been so fucking annoyed at that youcan17KEKL
I am so sick of hearing people publicly sharing opinions about things they don't have a clue about moistKEK
it prob was delayed based on what Nintendo wanted to do. but yeah it was never announced LUL
listen, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. but the "delaying switch 2" thing is so asinine youcan17LUL
my bud who loves x and y is hyped since z didn't happen
is that the gun from lunky?
I wouldn?t be mad about a new Pokemon Legends game with more polish. assuming it keeps a similar style to Arceys
the new game is apparently in the same universe as Pokemon X / Y
A Pok?mon card game, who knew Pok?mon was a card game?! chambo2Shrug LUL
but it?s a Legends game. so we are expecting closer to what Arceus was
rumor was that there was supposed to be a 3rd game in the x and y gen back in the day
@bullrunfarms I know at least one person on stream right now who didn't...
Arceus was the most fun I have had with a Pokemon game in a long time. but I never finished it.
Arceus was good, full stop
i liked arceus. it was such a good game. but pokemon yellow still holds true to being my favorite.
wait you didn?t play hockey with your hockey cards?
they are digitizing pokemon cards. which I thought was kind of neat chambo2Shrug
i used to have a big binder of xmen and marvel cards, wonder where those are now
I don?t like playing Pokemon trading card game with real people so chambo2Shrug
you get to open 2 free packs of pokemon cards a day on your phone. and you can play Pokemon TCG with others online on your phone.
trading card game = TCG
send me your mews zlove
I mean it was fine. it was specifically not labeled as a Pokemon Direct chambo2Shrug
TCG = money dump
it is pokemon day
yeah it?s a pokemon day presentation.
but Nintendo didn?t call it a direct
the day the og games came out
Shouldn't Pokemon day be a Poke-Monday?
poke-a-man day? chambo2Arrive
touch?
feb 6 was the birthday for mewtwo
i used to have 2 large totes 1 was of MTG cards and the other was Pokemon TCG cards and my ex sold both totes while i was at work one day
I thought it was Pokimane day NotLikeThis
Potentially 2 and a half...
@nerdyfamgayming your ex is a dick
@NerdyFamGayming ...and that's why he's your ex now?
@nerdyfamgayming that's why it's your ex i assume?
yes precisely why hes the ex. I left him the same day he did it.
@NerdyFamGayming  dang i hope the ex got some cement shoes

What's your fav Danganronpa? @admindude02
@rppriya the second one because of one man
@admindude02 hmm... Curious which one?
@admindude02 YUS
It's probably the best in the series
That was my guess in my head
2 is very superb, but I really liked 3... I think I'd pick it as the best for the most emotions it makes me feel
3 anime is good
gayGrabby
Technically think it's 3v the VN iirc .
yeah, V3 is awful. I was just making a joke because I like the 3 anime and hugely dislike V3
The anime was... I wish it was a little longer
there were two sides of 3 anime? it was pretty substantial
I get why people would like v3 but I think it's my favorite
wouldn't like*
There's just more I wish we could've seen given the huge world Danganronpa is, then again, I guess that's why there were lots of light novels...
In the anime

it didnt look that big outside holy shit

just a little bit of research from stackoverflow and thats it
I always wake up this time brakkiLazy
Good run
thanks!
I tried my best
lol nah I just wanted to give it a shot
hmmm okay I can see what I can do
NOAH!!!! Haro???
Coding is one thing i want to get better at once i have less things to do
LUL
It kind of is...
i'm here
yo noah
I meant real code not stupid asm
I'm excited to get back into more programming once I finish the art I need to finish
Jeez I have had VScode openned for 6 hours LUL
Coding is something I have no interest in since I tend to avoid things that I think I'd fail at.
wow
That's what he said.
Awwww
a dictionary holds keys and values right?
like {key: value}
what what?

for sure
yes
@Ixitxachitl And without actually learning, you probably can't be sure the AI got it right for all cases...
so if you make it != to 0 it would be odd right?
i use AI and get shit wrong all the time XD
yeah that makes sense
Mod and div are so good
list comprehensions
Its like in elementary school when we had division and always typed our rest x after
Modulu gives you the rest, div the number
Yeah
We had mod in maths in uni and it was cool
lol
awesome thank you so much
I'll let ya know.
dictionary comprehension is real btw
this isnt the preston hack feenNotes

@pyWiki go on....
Example if you want: {x: 2*x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0} katmakNerd
Take the evens in range, map them to their double.
And no spoilers!
hahaha
yup
If you change the first bit to: "Yay" + str(x): 2*x
Then "Yay4" string would map to number 8
give a dracula flow line when I enter
Yeah you did that shit while high. Impressive, Boss.
dracula flow
I was confused too. But I thought it was some code thing.
